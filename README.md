# Introduction
Toll-Booth is a desktop-based toll management system that allows toll operators to manage toll booths, collect toll fees, and generate reports. The project is built using the .NET 6 framework and SQLite database for data storage, and uses Material Design for UI.

The main goals of the Toll-Booth project are:
* To provide a user-friendly toll management system that can be used by toll operators and administrators.
* To automate toll collection and reduce the time and effort required to manage toll booths.
* To generate accurate reports on toll collection and traffic patterns.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Toll-Booth project, you will need to have .NET 6 SDK installed on your machine.

Once you have installed the necessary software, you can clone the Toll-Booth repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jokicjovan/Toll-Booth.git
```
Next, you can open the TollBooth.sln solution file in Visual Studio.
You will also need to restore the NuGet packages used in the project.

## Features and Functionality
The Toll-Booth application provides several features and functionalities, including:
* <strong>Toll Booth Management:</strong> Toll operators can create, edit, and delete toll booths and assign them to specific locations. Each toll booth has a unique name, location, and fee amount, and can be easily updated or removed as needed.

* <strong>Toll Collection:</strong> Toll operators can collect toll fees from drivers and record the transactions in the database. The application supports cash and credit card payments, and generates a receipt for each transaction. The transaction data is stored in the database and can be used to generate reports on toll collection.

* <strong>Reports: </strong> Administrators can generate reports on toll collection and traffic patterns, including daily, weekly, and monthly reports. The reports provide detailed information on the number of transactions, total revenue, and average fee per transaction.

* <strong>User Management:</strong> Administrators can create, edit, and delete user accounts and assign them to specific roles. The application supports two roles: Toll Operator and Administrator. Toll Operators can manage toll booths and collect toll fees, while Administrators have full access to all features and functionalities of the application.

Material Design UI: The application uses Material Design for UI, providing a modern and intuitive user interface that is easy to use and navigate.
